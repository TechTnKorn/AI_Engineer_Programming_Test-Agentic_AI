    Messages tracking the primary execution state of the agent.

    Typically accumulates a pattern of:
    1. HumanMessage - user input
    2. AIMessage with .tool_calls - agent picking tool(s) to use to collect information
    3. ToolMessage(s) - the responses (or errors) from the executed tools
    4. AIMessage without .tool_calls - agent responding in unstructured format to the user
    5. HumanMessage - user responds with the next conversational turn

    Steps 2-5 may repeat as needed.

    The `add_messages` annotation ensures that new messages are merged with existing ones,
    updating by ID to maintain an "append-only" state unless a message with the same ID is provided.
